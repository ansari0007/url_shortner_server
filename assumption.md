# Assumptions

This document outlines the assumptions made during the development of the URL Shortener application.

## General Assumptions

1. **Internet Connectivity**: 
   - Users have a stable internet connection to access and use the application.

2. **Modern Web Browser**:
   - Users are using a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) that supports the latest web standards and JavaScript features.

3. **User Base**:
   - The primary user base consists of individuals and small businesses who need a simple and reliable URL shortening service.

## Backend Assumptions

1. **Database Storage**:
   - MongoDB is assumed to be the primary database, providing sufficient performance and scalability for storing URL data.

2. **Security**:
   - Basic security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, are sufficient to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
   - User data, including URLs, is stored securely with appropriate access controls.



## Frontend Assumptions

1. **Responsive Design**:
   - The application’s user interface is designed to be responsive and work on various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

2. **Form Validation**:
   - Basic client-side validation is assumed to be sufficient to guide users in entering valid URLs and other input data.



## Technical Assumptions

1. **Deployment Environment**:
   - The application will be deployed on Vercel, which provides necessary resources for both the frontend and backend.
   - Serverless functions on Vercel will be sufficient for handling backend logic.

2. **Code Maintainability**:
   - The codebase will be modular and organized, following best practices to ensure maintainability and ease of updates.
   - Regular refactoring and code reviews will be conducted to maintain code quality.

## Conclusion

These assumptions are made to guide the development process and ensure a smooth user experience. They are based on typical use cases and expected user behavior. Any deviations from these assumptions may require adjustments to the application’s design and functionality.
